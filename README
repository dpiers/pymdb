pymdb - v0.0.1 by Daniel Piers

Pymdb is a small set of python functions for accessing IMDB movie/actor pages.
There is no reason to use pymdb over the vastly superior IMDBpy library.
Seriously, go to http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net and use that for any major projects.

I only made this to cheat in a trivia game.
